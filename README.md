OmicSciences: R & Bioconductor
==============================

## Overview

This repository contains a short presentation introducing some of the features
of the R programming language and Bioconductor software environment, along with
a few demos aimed at showing some of the various capabilities of them.

These materials were used as part of a presentation for a course titled
"OmicSciences and their Application in Biomedical Research".

## Demos

The demos included here are all very short and meant to give a feel for *some*
of the capabilities of R and Bioconductor.

Topics covered include:

1. [AnnotationHub](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationHub.html) - Bioconductor framework for accessing large number of annotation resources.
2. [ReCount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/) - Collection of analysis-ready RNA-Seq datasets.
3. [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) - interactive applications for R.
4. [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) - generation of reproducible PDF/HTML reports.
